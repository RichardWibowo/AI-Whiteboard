## initial

At first, i figured what i want to do, which is to do something that can help online class enviroment more like offline classroom. Then, i started cramming as many phyton basic skill since im not that familiar with phyton
i do know how to code and what datastructure but yeah, not really the same with JAVA.

## consultation

I understand that this is not a million dollar idea for startup, and the team realized me that while the idea is OK, its most likely that i wont be finish when its due, and therefore i decided
to reduce the scope of my intentions, and settle with this instead

## Open CV

openCV is definetly interesting since im not that familiar with it, alot of time i questions my ability to learn it in such a short time, luckly the material is all available at geek2geeks
so i can learn in=t quite effectively during the brake

## mediaPipe

because i spent a lot of time on the design than the actuall coding, i cant figure out how to use only openCV to draw, so i use mediapipe. which is more understandable although still hard
i manage to find some good tutorial in youtube 

## compromise

i do not regret starting this project, but i regret that i unable to implement some aspect that i want to, like the ability to add picture, and/or transparent picture, to make it easier to 
explain, or sensivity control.
