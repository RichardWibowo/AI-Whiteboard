welcome to my AI Whiteboard project, im using Mediapipe and openCV for this project, while Mediapipe is not really necessary, since we can hardcode it, i wanna use mediapipe to faster 
development, using Mediapipe is also beneficial for future projects, since i already made it as modular as possible.
