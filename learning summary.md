## understanding phyton
phyton is easy to learn but hard to master, the same goes for its libary. which is why i need to compromise with the idea of my project.
but i find it rewarding that i can now use computer vision, in my futher project, it is possible that this will be useful for futher projects 

## AI
it is interesting how AI works, although i only use it meagerly. 
there are a lot of potentials for this project that i can yet explore/ implement but i planning to learn more
